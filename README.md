#####################################################################
This is a attempt at making a bot/loot ESP Built for a old version 
of EmuTarkov, using Visual Studio 2022 with C++, I took the code and
made it work for SPT-Tarkov, updated the versions and files, and 
compiled it into a .DLL File for ease of installation.
Aimbot currently does not work couldn't figure it out.
#####################################################################
I do not own this CODE! The original maker of this code is written
by "DrGnomeo" and all credit goes to him I just used his repository to
get my feet wet and enter the realm of coding.

Container ESP (includes: Distance slider)
Exfil ESP

Has Aimbot Code (It broke with recent updates and I dont know enough about EFT/Unity internally to fix it, but feel free to patch it back together)

How to Install
As this is now a BepInEx Plugin, it's very straight forward to install from my pre-compiled DLL.

1. Copy the DLL into your AKI installation folder > BepInEx > plugins 

2. Profit!$$

3. NOTE: DO NOT CLOSE THE CMD WINDOW THAT OPENS WITH THE PLUGIN. Couldnt remove it.
