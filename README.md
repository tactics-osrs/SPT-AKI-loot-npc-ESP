# SPT-AKI-loot-npc-ESP
#####################################################################
This is a attempt at making a bot/loot ESP Built for a old version
of EmuTarkov, I took the code and made it work for SPT-Tarkov, updated the versions and files, and compiled it into a .DLL File for ease of installation.
#####################################################################
I do not own this CODE! The original maker of this code is written
by "DrGnomeo" and all credit goes to him I just used his repository to
get my feet wet and enter the realm of coding.

Exfil ESP
No-Recoil
Open any locked doors with NUM4
Has Aimbot Code (It broke with recent updates and I dont know enough about EFT/Unity internally to fix it, but feel free to patch it back together)

How to Install
As this is now a BepInEx Plugin, it's very straight forward to install from my pre-compiled DLL.

1. Copy the DLL into your AKI installation folder > BepInEx > plugins 

2. Profit!$$
